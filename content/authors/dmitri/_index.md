# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: My main research interests are in theory of complex systems and, therefore, they are in the interplay of mathematical physics, functional analysis, PDE, and probability theory. In particular, I have worked on problems dealing with infinite-dimensional analysis, applications of methods of functional analysis and probability theory to mathematical physics, Gibbs measures, point processes, stochastic dynamics and scaling limits, mathematical biology. Currently, I am actively working in the study of non-local evolution equations arising as (mesoscopics) limits for dynamics of the considered complex systems.

- Complex Systems
- Infinite-Dimensional Analysis
- Non-local Evolution Equations

I am an Associate Professor of Swansea University.

My main research interests are in theory of complex systems and, therefore, they are in the interplay of mathematical physics, functional analysis, PDE, and probability theory. welcome

In particular, I have worked on problems dealing with infinite-dimensional analysis, applications of methods of functional analysis and probability theory to mathematical physics, Gibbs measures, point processes, stochastic dynamics and scaling limits, mathematical biology. Currently, I am actively working in the study of non-local evolution equations arising as (mesoscopics) limits for dynamics of the considered complex systems.
